# Learn++

In this project, we implement the Learn++ ensemble algorithm in the paper "Polikar, Robi & Udpa, Lalita & S Udpa, Satish & Member, Senior & Honavar, Vasant. (2002). Learn++: An Incremental Learning Algorithm for Supervised Neural Networks. IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics Part C (Applications and Reviews). "

At the end of the day, our implementation obtains the same performance as the one in the paper.
